  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

<!--
   <p>
    The browser gives us an excellent tool for structuring web applications. It's called HTML. You may have heard of it! It's declarative, portable, well supported, and easy to work with. Great as HTML may be, its vocabulary and extensibility are limited. The HTML living standard has always lacked a way to automatically associate JS behavior with your markup... until now.
    <br/><br/>
    Custom elements are the answer to modernizing HTML, filling in the missing pieces, and bundling structure with behavior. If HTML doesn't provide the solution to a problem, we can create a custom element that does. Custom elements teach the browser new tricks while preserving the benefits of HTML.  From <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements">Google's web components</a>

    <ul>
      <li>Cross-browser (web standard) for creating and extending reusable components.
      <li>Requires no library or framework to get started. Vanilla JS/HTML!
      <li>Properties and methods of an element are defined with an element, not in a JS object.
      <li>Synchronous reaction to attribute and children DOM changes.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>NEW! a-router</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you want an element can react to the hash url change dynamically? 
    <br/> 
    <a href="https://custom-element.github.io/#router">&lt;a-router></a> does what you want.
  </ul>

    <li>
      <h3>What's the way to prevent FOUC, Flash Of Unstyled Contents?</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to do it. One way is not to disply HTML until page is loaded
        <pre class="prettyprint">
var elm=document.querySelector('html');
elm.style.display="none";
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", _ => elm.style.display="block");</pre>
